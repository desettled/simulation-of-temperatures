# Simulation of experimental and analytical results based on internal and external temperatures

This simulation illustrates the mathematical model depicting the internal temperature of an object over time and the external temperature of an object influenced by external temperature variations. It generates a graph comparing experimental and analytical findings, developed as part of a 2nd semester project at Tecnológico de Monterrey. It also computes the experimental error between the experimental and analytical results.
