# simulation-of-temperatures
This simulation illustrates the mathematical model depicting the internal temperature of an object over time and the external temperature of an object influenced by external temperature variations. It generates a graph comparing experimental and analytical findings, developed as part of a 2nd semester project at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey.
